      "Dr. Frankenstein is trying to create a new species of bacterium by splicing together the genomes of bacteria A and B. Unfortunately, he lost all but the first two pages of his notes describing how they were spliced together.  He needs your help to identify which parts of the frankengenome came from which bacterium.  You are given the full frankengenome called `frankengene1.fasta` as well as the first two pages of notes, called `trainingData1.txt` and `testData1.txt`, which have correct labels for the first 50,000 and the next 50,000 bases of the frankengenome respectively. The label `0` indicates the base came from genome A and the label `1` indicates it came from genome B.  E.g. the label `0000011111110011` indicates the first 5 bases came from genome A, the next 7 from genome B, the next 2 from genome A, and the last 2 from genome B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implement a classifier that assigns a label to each base of the frankengenome according to whether it came from genome A or B.  You are not expected to get the labels 100% correct; you will be graded based on your classifier's accuracy relative to a simple \"reference\" classifier.  Accuracy is measured as the fraction of genome positions given the correct label.\n",

      "A good way to solve this problem is using an HMM, similarly to how we solved the CpG island labeling problem in class.  You may borrow freely from the posted [HMM code](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BenLangmead/comp-genomics-class/blob/master/notebooks/CG_HMM.ipynb).\n",
      "\n",
      "When you build your classifier, build it using *only* the data from `trainingData1.txt`.  Then, when you test your classifier to assess accuracy, test it using *only* the data from `testData1.txt`.  This will give you a more accurate picture about how your classifier performs on the whole genome than if you build and test using the same data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hint: If you build your classifier using `trainingData1.txt` and use it to make predictions for `testData1.txt`, you should be able to label *at least* 98.5% of the positions correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hint: The `read_genome_and_training` and `read_training_pairs` functions defined below in Python can be helpful when building the transition and emission probability tables for the HMM.  Feel free to use them:"
