    "This notebook explores parsing and understanding the SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and related BAM format.  SAM is an extremely common format for representing read alignments.  Most widely-used read alignment tools output SAM alignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAM is a text format.  There is a closely related binary format called BAM.  There are two types of BAM files: unsorted or sorted.  Various tools, notably [SAMtools] and [Picard], can convert back and forth between SAM and BAM, and can sort an existing BAM file.  When we say a BAM file is sorted we almost always mean that the alignments are sorted left-to-right along the reference genome.  (It's also possible to sort a BAM file by read name, though that's only occassionally useful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have an interesting set of read alignments that you would like to keep for a while and perhaps analyze further, it's a good idea to keep them in *sorted BAM* files.  This is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They will be well compressed.  BAM files are smaller than corresponding SAM files, and *sorted* BAM files are smaller than corresponding *unsorted* BAM files.\n",
    "2. From a sorted BAM file, it's easy to extract just the alignments that overlap a specified stretch of the genome, making it easy to convert from sorted BAM to many other useful formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, most alignment tools output SAM (not BAM), and the alignments come out in an arbitrary order -- not sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "An authoritative and complete document describing the SAM and BAM formats is the [SAM specification].  This document is thorough, but, being a specification, it does not describe is the various \"dialects\" of legal SAM emitted by popular tools.  I'll cover some of that here.\n",
